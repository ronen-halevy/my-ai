# Logistic Regression

Logostic Regression is currently the most commom prediction model algorithm used by Machine Learning algorithms for binary classification. In case you're not familiar prediction models, and how to solve for their coefficients, I suggest you read my post on that before. Not mandatory though. If the term "Binary Classification" needs clarifications, I'd start with my Intro to Machine Learning. Not mandatory though.

In any case, to start with, I posted here again the Supervised Machine Learning blog diagram.

As Figure 1 shows, the predictor sits in the heart of the system. It is calculated during the Training phase, an then does the prediction during the Testing and Normal Data phases.

Let's walk top to bottom - we'll start with a classification problem, see how it is handled by the Logistic Regression predictor, and eventually we'll show we'll show how to solve for the Logostic Regression coefficient with the good-old Descent Regression algorithm.



In the heart 
This post is about Logistic Regression, which is currently the most commom prediction model used by Machine Learning algorithms for binary classification. 
Have you read my previous post on Linear Regression before? I recommend, as it details the basic terms and concepts of predictors and the calculation of their parameter.

Anyway, 

So, suppose our system needs to decide whether an input picture x is of a male or of a female.




Let's start with a simple binary classification example problem, and illustrate the need for the Logistic Regression model.
