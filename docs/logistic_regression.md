# Logistic Regression

This post is about Logistic Regression, which is currently the most commom prediction model used by Machine Learning algorithms for binary classification. 
Have you read my previous post on Linear Regression before? I recommend, as it details the basic terms and concepts of predictors and the calculation of their parameter.

Anyway, 

So, suppose our system needs to decide whether an input picture x is of a male or of a female.




Let's start with a simple binary classification example problem, and illustrate the need for the Logistic Regression model.
