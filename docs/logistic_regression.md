# Logistic Regression

Logostic Regression is currently one of the most commom prediction model algorithm used by Machine Learning algorithms for binary classification. In case you're not familiar prediction models, and how to solve for their coefficients, I suggest you read my post on that before. Not mandatory though. If the term "Binary Classification" needs clarifications, I'd start with my Intro to Machine Learning. Not mandatory though.

In any case, to start with, I posted here again the Supervised Machine Learning blog diagram.

As Figure 1 shows, the predictor sits in the heart of the system. It is calculated during the Training phase, an then does the prediction during the Testing and Normal Data phases.

Let's walk top to bottom - we'll start with a classification problem, see how it is handled by the Logistic Regression predictor, and eventually we'll see how to solve for the Logostic Regression coefficient with the good-old Descent Regression algorithm.


Here's the commonly used example single forbinary classification: Predict if a tumor is benign or maligent, based on its size. 


multi class



we need to predict if a customer will buy Iphone as his next phone, based on the next smartphone of a customer , which already owns a smatphone,  will buy another iphone after 2 years, based on whether he owned an iphone before or not. We'll see that normally a 
. This example is not realy realistic, but we'll use it to start with binary prediction based on a single feature. So, suppose we need to predict if a customer, which already owns a smatphone,  will buy an iphoe, based on whether he owned an iphone before or not. Suppose  that if he owned one
