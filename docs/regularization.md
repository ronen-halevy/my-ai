# Regularization

'When performing a machine learning task on a small dataset, one often suffers from the over-fitting problem, where the model accurately remembers all training data, including noise and unrelated features. Such a model often performs badly on new test or real data that have not been seen before. Because the model treats the training data too seriously, it failed to learn any meaningful pattern out of it, but simply memorizing everything it has seen.'
